# AUDIT QUEUE

One file. This is the only place a finding's status is true. It used to live in a
303KB task blob, two memory files and DESIGN.md at once, and they disagreed:
on 2026-09-01 I picked six "open" items off the old list and **all six had
already been fixed**, which I only discovered by reading the code each time.
That is what this file exists to stop.

Rules: a finding is CLOSED only with the build that closed it named beside it.
When a fix ships, update the row in the same commit. Do not trust a status you
did not just read here.

Source of the 2026-09-01 full-file audit (107 findings, 10 regions, each
adversarially verified):

(parse `.result`; line numbers in finder titles run 9-23 low).

## Closed, verified against the current file on 2026-09-01

| Finding | Closed by | How it was confirmed closed |
|---|---|---|
| `var cap` deleted while four readers remained; holding E threw | v8.37 | loot leg of `__verify` |
| v7.39 migration ran unstamped every load, wiping the mile's seal and fog | v8.38 | |
| `replaceCost` read `o.cost`, SHOP rows carry `price`; servicing ~6x too cheap | v8.38 | |
| district contracts never compared `ct.d` to `c.d` | v8.38 | |
| nameplates drawn from the centre of a centred plate, overflowing 82px | v8.39 | |
| belt `_eq` branch inverted `inHand` once `p.swapped` went true | v8.39 | |
| `padRelease` wiped `PAD.prev`; every pad button level-triggered | v8.39 | |
| safe pocket armed before buildRaid auto-packs, so it never fired | v8.40 | |
| DEV CHEAT BOX unconditional in shipping builds | v8.40 | |
| bot paid the water speed penalty twice (0.34 x 0.55) | v8.41 | read the code: `moveToward` now excludes the player |
| bot crouch noise discount applied twice | v8.41 | `CNOISE` carries only the wading factor |
| XP formula scored only 5 of 9 tracked kill kinds | v8.42 | `KILLXP` has all nine |
| contract payouts printed "+ XP" while the writer pays none | v8.42 | the "+ XP" text is gone from both surfaces |
| a bullet hitting a machine sent that machine after the PLAYER | v8.42 | |
| chosen sidearm accrued wear but never got the worn gun's stats | v8.43 | |
| "N notes logged" drawn left-aligned at W-16, off the right edge | v8.43 | `textAlign='right'` set locally at the call |
| HUD drag offset applied differently in drawing vs hit-testing | v8.44 | |
| a raider's equipped gun duplicated into its drop bag (~900c each) | v8.44 | probed 7 raiders: exactly one copy, dedupe guard live |
| merc ignored the LOOT order | v8.45 | |
| merc's cut paid from a number only a HUD draw updated | v8.46 | |
| contracts could never report completion mid-raid | v8.47 | probed: district contract goes 0/1 to 1/1 and stamps `contractsMid` |
| the great door's slab drew over everything, unsorted | v8.50 | |
| four routes out of the backpack never called `clearKeysFor` | v8.51 | |
| reinforcements arrived a minute early, first one instantly | v8.53 | |
| heal/plate wind-up bar drawn behind the player's own head | v8.54 | |
| fulgurite was a corpse, placed with no reachability test | v8.55 | 197/197 bad strike points relocated, median 40 units |
| roads crossed every authored wall (only 10 of 597 blocked one) | v8.55 | 446 and 802 crossings to 0, controlled against the v8.54 build |
| Warden and Bulwark used the light footstep | v8.55 | `__regress` checks all nine kinds every build |
| nine player-facing strings said "1 items" | v8.56 | each read back at n=1 and n>1 |
| a ring pillager's sight came from the PLAYER'S scope, skipping crouch and concealment | v8.43 | read the code: the call now passes the same values the chase branch uses |
| "closest you came to extraction" measured to the targeted ring, not the nearest open one | v8.58 | 152m vs 387m on cold, 166m vs 381m on the mile |
| the sector board printed a dimension in hectares, ten times too small | v8.58 | rendered board now reads 420 by 340 metres, 14.3 hectares |
| the down message asked for medical that self-revive never needed | v8.58 | emptied the bag, went down, F worked: 40hp, one revive |
| the workshop promised jamming while every wear band is jam 0 | v8.58 | text corrected; a regress check watches the table |
| melee swung with no line of sight test on either the crawler or the Listener | v8.59 | 9 wall-separated geometries inside reach on the mile, all 9 now refused |
| rolling froze heal-over-time completely | v8.59 | 30 queued points applied 0 while rolling, 30 standing still; now equal |

## Could not reproduce

| Finding | What I did | Result |
|---|---|---|
| shooting a Crier before it spots you leaves `wind` NaN, HUD prints "CRIER NaNs" | swept 4 raids x 150s on both maps for any NaN numeric field on any entity or the player | no NaN found. Both writers of `state='alarm'` set `wind` on the same line. Reopen only with a repro. |
| `nRaider:0` from the Settings row produces an empty map | set it and counted kinds | it removes raiders and nothing else: 58 ents to 51, every other kind intact. The row does what it says. |

## Open

| Finding | Note |
|---|---|
| the collision push-out can eject a body through a wall thinner than its radius | v8.59: 8 of 1228 thin walls on the mile did it when the player was placed overlapping one. NOT established that real play reaches that overlapped state - the stepper I used also moves the player. |
| extraction pull `z.pullT` may bank progress when you leave the ring | v8.58: my probe could not START a pull, so it proves nothing either way. Needs a repro that gets pullT above 0. |
| melee: no merc exclusion, no aggro, no break | v8.59 closed the wall/LOS half. Armour was already applied by damagePlayer, so that part of the finding was wrong. The rest is unreproduced. |
| Howler splash on a possum crawler leaves it at hp<=0 in G.ents forever | from the raid audit, not yet reproduced |
| beacon investigate overwrites the Listener's hunt | from the raid audit, not yet reproduced |
| burst echo excluded from wear, fires the OLD gun's stats after a swap | from the raid audit, not yet reproduced |
| death screen HEALTH/DAMAGE columns record pre-hit, pre-armour values | from the raid audit, not yet reproduced |
| closeSchedule absolute seconds vs a scaled raid clock; a ring can close on frame 1 under SHORT WINDOW | from the raid audit, not yet reproduced |
| ~85 remaining mediums and lows from the full-file audit | not yet triaged into this table |

## For his ruling, not a defect

- The extract-closure comment says points close "leaving one". True on COLD
  STORAGE (3 rings); THE COLD MILE has 6 and only 2 ever close, so the late-raid
  squeeze barely happens on the bigger map. Matching the comment is a large
  difficulty change on the map that already extracts higher (23.5 vs 18.0).

## For his ruling, added v8.58

- **Should worn guns jam?** The mechanic is built and wired end to end: the wear
  step's jam figure is copied onto the weapon and the firing path rolls against
  it and jams the gun for 0.9 seconds. All four wear bands carry `jam:0`, so it
  has never once fired. The workshop used to advertise it; that text is now
  corrected rather than the table changed, because turning it on is a balance
  decision. One table edit switches it on whenever he wants it.
